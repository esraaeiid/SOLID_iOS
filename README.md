SOLID iOS conceptes with examples from Mahara-Tech Course

# Single Responsibility
###### A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
###### Each class or type you define should have only one job to do.
###### That doesnâ€™t mean you can only implement one method, but each class needs to have a focused, specialized role.
> Applied in this project Using Protocol And Delegation.


# Open-Closed
###### Software entities, including classes, modules and functions, should be open for extension but closed for modification.
###### This means you should be able to expand the capabilities of your types without having to alter them drastically to add what you need.
> Applied in this project Using Abstarction.


# Liskov Substitution




# Interface Segregation




# Dependency Inversion
