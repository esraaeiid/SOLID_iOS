SOLID iOS conceptes with examples from Mahara-Tech Course

# Single Responsibility
###### A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
###### Each class or type you define should have only one job to do.
###### That doesn’t mean you can only implement one method, but each class needs to have a focused, specialized role.
> Applied in this project Using Protocol And Delegation.


# Open-Closed
###### Software entities, including classes, modules and functions, should be open for extension but closed for modification.
###### This means you should be able to expand the capabilities of your types without having to alter them drastically to add what you need.
> Applied in this project Using Abstarction.


# Liskov Substitution
###### Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
###### In other words, if you replace one object with another that’s a subclass and this replacement could break the affected part, then you’re not following this principle.

     * If we want to use object from a class as a parameter, we don't need to know it that object is from the parent class or the child class.
     * If we want to subclass a specific class, we should actually planning to use all the parent class properities/ methods or must need them.

> Applied in this project Using Protocol.
